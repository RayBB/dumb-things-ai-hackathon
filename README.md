# SF Bay Fishtank

What if we put a bunch of things from the San Francisco Bay Area and put them in a fishtank?
Well that's what I did here for the [Dumb Things 2.0 AI Hackathon with Replicate, DigitalOcean, SignalFire VC, and BytePlus](https://luma.com/qwnhi88t).

This project won for the category of "bluest hack"! ðŸ”µ

You can try it here: https://rayberger.org/sf-bay-fishtank/

Built with:
 - Chatterbox model on Replicate to generate voices
 - Audio: [Aquatic Ambience by Scizzie](www.youtube.com/watch?v=DP3rDP02lE0)
 - [Cursor Effects](https://tholman.com/cursor-effects/)
 - A lot of vibe coding using Grok in Windsurf
